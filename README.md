#### Run project

> - Run `npm run dev` to start the server
> - Go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to interact with
>   the build version of the app which is statically being served by the backend.
> - If you want to play with code and see the live updates
>   go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
> - Everytime you make updates to the code and want to see the updates live
>   in the "build version" of the application be sure to run
>   `npm run build` and start the server again.
